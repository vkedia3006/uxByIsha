                As a UX Professional, I had the exciting opportunity to work on
                a startup project that aimed to connect prospective
                international students with current/alumni students from their
                prospective universities. The goal was to provide valuable
                insights, guidance, and support to students during their
                university selection process. Throughout this project, I
                followed a user-centered approach to ensure the platform's
                design aligns with the needs and expectations of both the
                founders and the target users.{" "}

                To kickstart the project, I conducted an in-depth discussion
                with the founders to understand their vision and objectives.
                Here are some example questions I asked:
                <ul>
                  <li>What inspired you to create this startup?</li>
                  <li>How did you identify the need for such a platform?</li>
                  <li>
                    What are the primary goals you want to achieve with this
                    platform?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How do you envision the platform impacting prospective
                    international students?

                  >
                    Next, I organized a meeting with the project team, which
                    included the founder, product manager, and software
                    developer. In this session, I aimed to build empathy for the
                    prospective users by having each team member put themselves
                    in the users' shoes. We explored various aspects, such as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Challenges faced by students while shortlisting
                        universities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Factors they consider during their university search.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The type of experiences they seek during the
                        decision-making process.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  >
                    Following the empathy building exercise, I facilitated a
                    brainstorming session to gather ideas from the team as
                    potential users. We discussed what features they would like
                    to see in the platform. Using the "How Might We" (HMW)
                    framework, we formulated questions to refine and focus our
                    design direction.

                feedback from investors that would significantly impact the
                platform's accessibility. The feedback highlighted that the
                platform would be better served as a website instead of an app
                as it will have cross-platform compatibility and is
                cost-effective. This posed a considerable challenge for the

                The decision to switch to a website came with its share of
                challenges. After investing significant time and effort in
                designing the app and creating the high-fidelity prototype, I
                had to face the reality of starting from scratch. This required
                redesigning the entire user interface and user experience to
                adapt it for the website platform.

                One of the critical challenges was to ensure that the website
                experience matched the intuitive and user-friendly interactions
                envisioned for the app. I had to carefully restructure the
                navigation, layout, and interactions to optimize the experience
                for larger screens and mouse/trackpad input.

                As a UX Professional, I had to emphasize adaptability and

                an opportunity to revisit and refine the design, ensuring that
                the website platform would deliver a seamless and engaging
                experience for users.
